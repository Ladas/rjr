# Base RJR Node interface. Nodes are the central transport mechanism of rjr,
# this class provides the core methods common among all transport types and
# mechanisms to start and run the eventmachine reactor which drives all requests.
#
# A subclass of RJR::Node should be defined for each transport that is supported,
# implementing the 'listen' operation to listen for new requests and 'invoke_request'
# to issue them.
